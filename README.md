# PartyApp

Running Rails v4.2.6
The app requires Devise for user authentication to work.

DataBase has 2 tables

## User Table

Intended for the regular user all default constraints created by devise generator 

## ServiceProvider Table

Intended for the service providers and uses same constraints and columns as User table

Both tables have separate models with same names. Need to add additional forms and routs to service providers to add details.
