# PartyApp

Let users create a party from scratch without contacting multiple people. Service Providers can advertise services ranging from places for rent through DJs, Catering services etc. 

Current Market - None
Potential Market - School/College students, Weddings, Corporate Parties, Birthday Parties, Special events.

Running Rails v4.2.6
The app requires Devise for user authentication to work.

DataBase has 2 tables

## User Table

Intended for the regular user all default constraints created by devise generator 

## ServiceProvider Table

Intended for the service providers and uses same constraints and columns as User table

Both tables have separate models with same names. Need to add additional forms and routs to service providers to add details.
